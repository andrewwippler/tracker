Tracker is a simple program used to track and control how much time your users spend online.


HOW IT WORKS

tracker is a daemon that looks into /proc/net/tcp, checks for networking activity for each user and adjusts time left from a quota persisted in a per user log file found under /var/log/tracker/
Default quota is 1 hour.
Simple GUIs allows the user to display his/her remaining time left.
Administrator can increase/decrease the remaining time by modifying the time left in the user specific log file.


INSTALL

  make
  cp tracker /usr/local/bin/

add to system startup. E.g. add tracker to your /etc/rc.local script

  mkdir /var/log/tracker/

for each user you want to monitor, do

  touch /var/log/tracker/$kidloginname


RUNNING

edit the /var/log/tracker/$kidloginname file if you want to add some time.
